# Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation
# Description
This C++ program converts an infix expression to postfix notation, evaluates the postfix expression, and checks for balanced brackets. It utilizes **`stacks`** for expression conversion and evaluation, and it includes functionality to handle basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^).
# Features
`Infix to Postfix Conversion:` Converts an infix expression to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm.

`Postfix Evaluation:` Evaluates the postfix expression to obtain the result.

`Bracket Checking:` Checks if the input expression has balanced brackets ((, ), [, ], {, }).

`Colorful Console Output:` Utilizes ANSI escape sequences for colored output to enhance readability.
# Requirements
